# order-pizza
Order pizza from the command line

### Update (April 10 2016)
I have started reverse engineering the pizza Hut API using [WrapAPI](https://wrapapi.com). Right now it does not look like the public features of WrapAPI are working directly yet, but when they do my repo there is /yetanotherminion/pizza\_hut. I'll clean up those endpoints as well so that it is easier to follow what Pizza Hut is doing.
